 Wi! wiki
==========

Ultra-minimalistic wiki written in KSH (*Korn Shell*). Very small, just a single CGI script.
All the content of the wiki is stored in a mercurial repository, each article is
saved in a separated file. It is so simple that it doesn't have any user management
(*KISS philosophy*).


 Features
----------

- Dead-simple
- File-based using Mercurial
- Content optionally generated statically
- Markdown syntax


 Dependencies
--------------

- KSH
- Web server with CGI support
- Mercurial revision control


 Screenshot
------------

Look at the included file `imgs/wi-screenshot.png`.


 Install
---------

Just copy `wi.ksh` to your CGIs directory. You also need to create a Mercurial
repository with read/write permission for the CGI script. Copy `wi.css` to the
repository.

Look at the top of the CGI to customize the two variables with the location of
the wiki repository and the CGI URL path (they are used from the root of the
URL web server).


 Usage
-------

Apart from the CGI functionality, you can run the next command to create a
static version of the content:

		wi.ksh --generate-static

This is useful for a cron job to replicate statically the content of the wiki
every day.

*It's highly recommended to run the CGI as a dedicated user for such task, as the
shell script CGIs are always in danger of exploitation.*

If you find unpleasant the idea of a public wiki with no user management, just
put the wiki in some hidden place and show to the public the static version.

Note: the **Undo** button is just a **rollback** on the Mercurial repository.
